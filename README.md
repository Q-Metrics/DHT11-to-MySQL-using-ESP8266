# DHT11 to MySQL using ESP8266
Store DHT11 Data to MYSQL Using ESP8266 and Existing Libraries

After hunting many other souces I could not find a single Arduino IDE to accomplish this, but what I did find is that it could be done using existing libraries.

Using libraries already available in the Arduino IDE this single Arduino Code will enable you to connect to an existing MySQL database and store temperature and hunidity readins from a DHT11.

This could easily be modified to store other sensor outputs.
